# Histórias Vivas (Living Stories)

**Living Stories** is a web application that allows users to record audio directly from the browser, transcribe it, generate PDF files, and interact with the content using AI (ChatPDF).

**Context:**  
The initial idea was to create an app where people could register, save, and access their personal "memories".  
This prototype was developed by me as a student in the 7th semester of college.
The goal was to build a simple application that allows people suffering from mental conditions such as Alzheimer’s to remember who they are, by recording their name, age, and other personal stories.  

It’s a simple project, but it works.
I hope you like it! :)
